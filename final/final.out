\BOOKMARK [2][-]{subsection.1.1}{Someone proposes to schedule the jobs based on the descending order of the value of the corresponding customers. That is, the one with the highest value get the job scheduled first. In the above example, the customer with value 20 is scheduled before the customer with the value of 2.
