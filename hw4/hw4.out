\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.1}{Given the random process described above, what is the expected number of incoming links to node vj in the resulting network? Give an exact formula in terms of n and j, and also try to express this quantity asymptotically \(via an expression without large summations\) using \040notation}{}% 1
\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.2}{Part \(1\) makes precise sense in which the nodes that arrive early carry an \215unfair\216 share of the connections in the network. Another way to quantify the imbalance is to observe that, in a run of this random process, we expect many nodes to end up with no incoming links. Give a formula for the expected number of nodes with no incoming links in a network grown randomly according to this model.}{}% 2
