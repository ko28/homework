- Logic:  The efficiency of the resolution algorithm,  first-order logic    

- Game: the complexity of alpha-beta pruning, game-playing for large games

- Clustering: how to pick starting cluster centers, and how to pick the number of clusters

- Linear models (linear/logistic regression): Linear regression using nonlinear features

- NN: how to pick the number of neighbors
