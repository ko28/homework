## P1: Implement and Test DataStructureADT
For this assignment, you are given an ADT and several implementations of that ADT in the form of class files.  You are also given an abstract JUnit super class with a few example JUnit tests.  You are required to implement the ADT and write JUnit tests to ensure that your implementation and the other implementations work correctly.  

For each data structure implementation class given to you that you wish to test, you must write a test class. In this case, we will be giving you many implementations to test so that means many test classes are required.  However, the tests in each test class will be the same.  This means that we can use inheritance to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written and still ensure that all implementations are tested with all tests.

Grade 30/30

## P2: BST and Balanced Search Tree AVL
For this assignment, you are required to implement the BST (Binary Search Tree) class, the AVL balanced search tree class, and a JUnit test class that shows that your implementations are complete and correct.
The provided starter source files establish the inheritance hierarchy that we require for this assignment. 

Grade 27/30

## P3a: Hash Table
Hash table implementation in Java. 

Grade 30/30

## P3b: Performance Analysis
For this project, you will be implementing a small program to analyze the performance of your hash table against Java's built-in TreeMap.  TreeMap (Links to an external site.) is a known and in-built data structure of Java.

To analyze the performance, you need to write a small program that performs the same operations on both your custom HashTable class and Java's TreeMap class. You will be using Java Flight recorder to create a program profile, and Java Mission Control to analyze the profile information.  Both are open source and packaged with Oracle JVMâ€™s (The lab machines have this installed).

Grade 30/30

## P4: Package Manager
You will build a dependency graph from a list of given software packages and their dependencies. In the graph created, each vertex represents a package.  And, each edge represents a dependency between two packages.  For example, A depends on B is represented by a directed edge from B to A, indicating that B must occur before A.

Once the graph class is created, you will implement and test the required utility functions.  Write JUnit test classes and a main method in PackageManager to ensure that your functions work.

Use the graph algorithms discussed in lecture to implement the required functions.
