p3b CONCLUSIONS.TXT

Complete p3b and answer the following questions using results of running
Java Flight Recorder and Java Mission Control to justify your conclusions..

1) What can you tell about the performance of your hash table implementation compared to Java's tree map? 
Explain why (or when) your hash table is better or worse than Java's Tree Map.

Hash Table will be faster in almost every possible way compared to Tree Map. Hash Table
is implemented in a way that the average insert, get, and remove is O(1). Tree Map on the 
other hand uses a red-black tree which its insert, get, and remove is O(log n). Hash Table 
will be worse in the case if it needs to resize however that happens very rarely. 

2) What did you observe in java mission control to come to the conclusion above?

Hash table used up far less memory and computational power than tree map. This was true
in all the test that I've ran: insert, get, and remove. 

3) SCREENSHOT_001.PNG NOTES: Briefly describe what this image 001 shows

Shows the percent usage of the various methods used in by hash table and tree map. Hash table
was far more efficient across the board. Hash table insert was around 8% and tree map insert was 
around 41%, about log(n) greater than hash table insert, exactly what we had predicted. Hash table's
remove and get had no measurable usage because it is O(1) while treemap's remove and get was around
9%. 

4) SCREENSHOT_002.PNG NOTES: Briefly describe what this image 002 shows

Shows the heap usage of treemap and hash table. Across the board Hash Table used far less memory.
