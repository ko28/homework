  1.desc - schedtest user app test - invoking user application schedtest 1 14 2 3 100
  2.desc - new syscall test - fork2() a child process with timeslice 7, then getslice() on it, expecting 7
  3.desc - new syscall test - fork2() with negative timeslice, getslice() with negative pid, should both return -1
  4.desc - new syscall test - setslice() on a process itself to 3, then getpinfo() and check the timeslice has been set
  5.desc - new syscall test - setslice() on negative pid an with negative timeslice, should both return -1
  6.desc - new syscall test - getpinfo() given a ridiculously large pointer, should fail and return -1
  7.desc - round-robin scheduling test - only one process, do same workload before/after setslice(), compare num switches
  8.desc - round-robin scheduling test - two processes, parent peeks at child's schedticks and verify == its timeslice x switches
  9.desc - round-robin scheduling test - five processes, parent peeks at children's schedticks and verify each == its timeslice x switches
  10.desc - round-robin scheduling test - six processes, parent checks children all have the same num of switches in the middle
  11.desc - round-robin scheduling test - two children with timeslice 10 vs 2 doing the same workload, parent checks finish order
  12.desc - compensation related test - only one process, sleeps for some ticks, checks compticks & sleepticks are consistent with the sleep
  13.desc - compensation related test - three processes, parent sleeps full cycle when children run, checks sleepticks & compticks
  14.desc - compensation related test - two processes, parent sleeps for shorter than child timeslice, checks sleepticks & compticks
  15.desc - compensation related test - two children, one uses part of comp ticks, remainder should not accumulate on next cycle
  16.desc - compensation related test - ten children, one with timeslice 2 but slept 80, others with timeslice 4, check finish order
  17.desc - compensation related test - one process loops on sleep(5) and do workload, compticks used should progress along the way
  18.desc - extra safety check - process setslice of itself to 100, should reflect immediately in the cycle
  19.desc - extra safety check - runs built-in forktest, should say ok
