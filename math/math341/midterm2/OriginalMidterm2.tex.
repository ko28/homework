This exam contains \numpages\ pages (including this cover page) and
\numquestions\ problems.  Check to see if any pages are missing.  Enter
all requested information on the top of this page, and put your initials
on the top of every page, in case the pages become separated.\\

You are required to show your work on each problem on this exam.  The following rules apply:\\

\begin{minipage}[t]{3.7in}
\vspace{0pt}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{If you use a ``theorem'' you must indicate this} and explain
why the theorem may be applied.

\item \textbf{Organize your work} in a neat and coherent way. Work scattered 
all over the page without a clear ordering will receive very little credit. 

\item \textbf{Mysterious or unsupported answers will not receive full
credit}.  A correct answer, unsupported by calculations, explanation,
or algebraic work will receive no credit; an incorrect answer supported
by substantially correct calculations and explanations might still receive
partial credit.


\item This is an open book, take-home midterm, are free to collaborate; however, 
you need to disclaim your sources, and more importantly you need to write 
\textbf{your own solutions}.

\item You will submit your \texttt{.tex} and \texttt{.pdf} files online 
before Thursday April 9th at 23:59.

\end{itemize}

Do not write in the table to the right.

\question Let
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A} = \left [ \begin{array}{cc}
            			a & b \\
            			c & d
    				  \end{array} \right ],

\begin{parts}
\part[10]
Suppose that $a\neq 0 $, compute the solution of $\mathbf{Ax = b}$ using row reduction and provide the conditions on $a,b,c,d$ such that your computations are valid. Express the result as a simplified expression. (\textbf{Hint:} recall that you can not divide by zero.)

%% Write your solutions here 

% \newpage
\part[5] If $a = 0$, and $c\neq 0$, is your above computation still valid? How would you modify it? (explain briefly)  (\textbf{Hint:} recall that you can swap the equations and the result is the same.)

%% Write your solutions here 

% \newpage
\part[5] If $a = 0$, $c=0$, but $b \neq 0$, $d \neq 0$, what are the conditions on $e$ and $f$ such that the system $\mathbf{Ax=b}$ has a solution? Is the solution unique?  (\textbf{Hint:} recall that $\mathbf{Ax = b}$ has a solution if and only if $\mathbf{b}$ can be written as a linear combination of the columns of $\mathbf{A}$.)

% \newpage
\part[5] Solve the system
\begin{equation}
\left [ \begin{array}{cc}
            \sqrt{2} & 3\sqrt{2}  \\
            2\sqrt{2} & \sqrt{2}
    \end{array} \right ] \left ( \begin{array}{c}
            x_1 \\
            x_2

            5\sqrt{2} \\
            5\sqrt{2}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Second Question %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newpage
\addpoints
\question Let
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{A} = \left [ \begin{array}{cccc}
            0 & - \alpha & 2       & 0 \\
            1 &  1        & 0       & 1 \\
            2 &  2        & 2       & 3 \\
           -2 & -2        & 4  & 2\alpha \\
            0 & \alpha   & -1  & 2\alpha + 1/2
    \end{array} \right ], \qquad  \mbox{and }
    \mathbf{b} =  \left [ \begin{array}{c}
            2    \\

            2 + \alpha \\
            2 \beta + \alpha -2
    \end{array} \right ]

What are the conditions on $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that the system $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$:

\begin{parts}
\part[5] has no solution?

% \newpage
\part[5] has an unique solution? Find the solution. (\textbf{Hint:} you will need to row reduce the augmented system to echelon form, and then use the theorems seen in class to impose the conditions on $\alpha$ and $\beta$.)
% \newpage

\part[10] has infinite amount of solutions? Find the solution set in parametric form. (\textbf{Hint:} You may have one equations for $\alpha$ and one for $\beta$ that have to be satisfied simultaneously)


\end{parts}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Third Question %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage 
\question 
Let $A \in M_{n\times n}(F)$, for a field $F$. We want to prove that $rank(A^2) - rank(A^3) \leq rank(A) - rank(A^2)$. 
The solution to this exercise requires the notion of quotient spaces. Even though you should already be familiar with quotient spaces we will prove a few properties that will be useful. 

Let \(\mathrm{W}\) be a subspace of a vector space \(\mathrm{V}\) over a field \(F .\) For any \(v \in \mathrm{V}\) the set \(\{v\}+\mathrm{W}=\{v+w: w \in \mathrm{W}\}\) is called the coset of W containing \(v .\) It is customary to denote this coset by \(v+W\) rather than \(\{v\}+W\).
Following this notation we write $\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{W} = \{ v + \mathrm{W}: v \in \mathrm{V} \}$, which is usually called the quotient space $\mathrm{V}$ module $\mathrm{W}$. Addition and scalar multiplication by scalars can be defined in the collection \(\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{W}\) as follows:
$$
\left(v_{1}+\mathrm{W}\right)+\left(v_{2}+\mathrm{W}\right)=\left(v_{1}+v_{2}\right)+\mathrm{W}
$$
for all \(v_{1}, v_{2} \in \mathrm{V}\) and
$$
a(v+W)=a v+W
$$
for all \(v \in \mathrm{V}\) and \(a \in F\)

\begin{parts}
\part [5] Prove that \(v_{1}+\mathrm{W}=v_{2}+\mathrm{W}\) if and only if \(v_{1}-v_{2} \in \mathrm{W}\). (\textbf{Hint}: recall that $v_{1}+\mathrm{W}$ is a set, thus you need to prove equality between sets.)

\part [5] Show that \(\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{W}\) with the operations defined above is a linear vector space. 

\part [5] Prove that if $\mathrm{V} < \infty$ then $dim(\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{W}) = dim(\mathrm{V}) - dim(\mathrm{W})$. (Hint: Define a linear map $T:\mathrm{V} \rightarrow \mathrm{V}/\mathrm{W}$ such that the range of $T$ is $\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{W}$, and then use the rank-nullity theorem.)

\part[5] Let $K = F^n$, define $AK = R(L_A)$, and $A^2K = R(L_{A^2})$. Show that $AK/A^2K$ is a vector space of dimension $rank(A) - rank(A^2)$. 

\part[5] Show that $A^2K/A^3K$ is a vector space of dimension $rank(A^2) - rank(A^3)$, where $A^3K= R(L_{A^3})$.

\part[5] Define $T: AK/A^2K \rightarrow A^2K/A^3K$, by $T(v) = L_A(v)$, i.e, we left multiply each element of $v$ by the matrix $A$. Show that $R(T) = A^2V/A^3V$.

\part[5] Use the rank-nullity theorem on $T$ to conclude that $rank(A^2) - rank(A^3) \leq rank(A) - rank(A^2)$.


\end{parts}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Fourth Question %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\question 

Let $\mathrm{V}$ be a finite-dimensional vector space. Let $T$ and $P$ be two linear transformations from $\mathrm{V}$ to itself, such that $T^2= P^2 = 0$, and $T \circ P + P \circ T = I$, where $I$ is the identity in $\mathrm{V}$.

\begin{parts}

\part[5] Denote $N_T = N(T)$ and $N_P = N(P)$, the null spaces of $T$ and $P$, respectively. Show that $N_P = P(N_T)$, and $N_T = T(N_P)$, where $T(N_P) = \{ T(v): v \in N_P \}$ and $P(N_T) = \{ P(v): v \in N_T \}$.

\part[5] Show that $\mathrm{V} = N_T \oplus N_P$.

\part[5] Prove that the dimension of $\mathrm{V}$ is even. 

\part[5] Suppose that the dimension of $\mathrm{V}$ is two. Prove that $\mathrm{V}$ has a basis $\beta$, such that
\begin{equation}
	[T]_{\beta} = \left [ \begin{array}{cc}
						0 & 1 \\
						0 & 0 
						\end{array} \right] \qquad \text{ and} 	[P]_{\beta} = \left [ \begin{array}{cc}
						0 & 0 \\
						1 & 0 
						\end{array} \right] .
\end{equation}
